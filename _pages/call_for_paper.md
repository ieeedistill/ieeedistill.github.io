### Guidelines

* Paper submission is hosted on [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2023/Workshop/Instruction).
* We welcome papers __up to 9 pages (max)__, not including references or appendix. 
  * Please use the provided LaTex template ([zip](/assets/template/instruction_workshop_template.zip), [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/instruction-workshop-at-neurips-2023-template/fqkhtqxvjrrq)) for your submission.
  * The paper should be anonymized and uploaded to OpenReview as a single PDF. 
  * You may use as many pages of references and appendix as you wish, but reviewers are not required to read the appendix. 
  * We welcome 4-page extended abstract submissions.
* This is a __non-archival__ workshop. No submission will be indexed nor have archival proceedings.
  * Accepted papers will appear on the workshop website. 
  * They will also be available on OpenReview and NeurIPS virtual site.
  * We accept submissions that are under review at other venues (e.g., ICLR 2024), as long as this does not violate the dual-submission / anonymity policy of the other venue.
* The review process will be double-blind.
* We will announce the best paper award at the workshop!
